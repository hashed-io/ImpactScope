### Overview

The Greenwasher Identifier (GWI) project seeks to utilize blockchain and AI to create a transparent, decentralized platform to verify and score the environmental claims of organizations, thus empowering consumers with reliable information. Similarly, GWI can be used internally by corporate entities to continually monitor all types of reporting, social media and company communications to check for potential occurrences of greenwashing before such content is made public.

### Project Details
This tool serves as a proactive solution for financial supervisory authorities, asset managers, and companies to save thousands of hours annually while ensuring compliance with evolving regulatory standards. 
- **Objective:** Develop a decentralized application (dApp) to identify and score corporate greenwashing practices using blockchain and AI.
- **Relevance:** Aligns with Web3 Foundation's goals by promoting transparency, decentralization, and leveraging blockchain technology to address societal challenges.
- **Technology Stack:**
    * **Blockchain for Transparency:** Utilize a blockchain to record and verify environmental claims, ensuring immutability and transparency.
    * **AI for Analysis:** Implement AI algorithms to evaluate the authenticity of companies' environmental efforts and assign scores.
- **Core Components:** AI modules for qualitative and quantitative analysis and blockchain integration for preserving records on the IPFS, linked through individual hash addresses on the Astar chain.
- **User-Friendly Dashboard:** A comprehensive dashboard provides stakeholders with real-time insights, analytics, and access to reports, enhancing decision-making based on accurate and verified metrics.

### Ecosystem Fit

- Integration into Ecosystem: The GWI fits into the ecosystem as a unique tool leveraging both AI and blockchain technologies to monitor, verify, and report on environmental claims, enhancing transparency and accountability in corporate sustainability efforts.
- Target Audience: Financial regulatory bodies, asset managers, and corporations focusing on sustainable practices.
- Needs Addressed: The demand for accurate monitoring and reporting on green practices to combat greenwashing.
- Unique Aspect: Unlike any existing projects within the ecosystem, GWI uniquely combines AI's analytical power with blockchain's immutability to create a comprehensive greenwashing detection system.
