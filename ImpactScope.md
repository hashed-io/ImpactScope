### Overview

The Greenwasher Identifier (GWI) project is set to migrate its blockchain infrastructure to Substrate, enhancing its capabilities to create a more transparent, decentralized platform. This platform aims to verify and score environmental claims of organizations, aiding consumers and corporate entities in identifying greenwashing practices.

### Project Details

Utilizing blockchain and AI, GWI provides a solution for financial regulatory authorities, asset managers,  to save thousands of hours annually while ensuring compliance with evolving regulatory standards. This migration to Substrate offers improved scalability, interoperability, and smart contract functionality.

- **Objective:** Migrate GWI from its current blockchain base to Substrate, integrating new functionalities to track publicly available information changes, enhancing transparency and data integrity.
- **Relevance:** Aligns with the Web3 Foundation's mission by leveraging Substrate to promote decentralization and address contemporary social challenges.
- **Technology Stack:**
    * **Substrate for Blockchain:** Utilize Substrate for its modularity, flexibility, and rich ecosystem for blockchain development.
    * **AI for Analysis:** Continue to leverage AI for evaluating organizational environmental efforts and scoring their authenticity.
- **Core Components:** Include AI modules for analysis, Substrate-based Smart Contract (Pallet) for data integrity, and IPFS integration for data storage.
- **User Interface and Verification API:** A user-friendly interface and an API for external applications, enabling easy access to verified public information.
- **Comprehensive Reporting:** Generates detailed reports highlighting discrepancies, unsubstantiated claims, and potential inconsistencies in environmental disclosures.

### Ecosystem Fit

- **Integration into Ecosystem:** GWI takes a unique position in the ecosystem by leveraging Substrate to combat greenwashing, encouraging an environment of trust and accountability.
- **Target Audience:** Expanding to include NGOs, financial regulatory bodies, asset managers, and corporations committed to genuine sustainable practices.
- **Needs Addressed:** The demand for accurate monitoring and reporting on green practices to combat greenwashing.
- **Unique Aspect:** Unlike any existing projects within the ecosystem, GWI uniquely combines AI's analytical power with blockchain's immutability to create a comprehensive greenwashing detection system.

**Key Findings:**
  1. Identification of non-material treatment of water, biodiversity, and emissions contrary to claims of sustainability leadership
  2. Contradictions in renewable energy commitments vs. the absence of specific emissions reduction targets.
  3. Unlikely achievement of net zero emissions by 2050 based on existing scientific consensus.
  4. Obscured overall carbon footprint due to non-disclosure of non-UK sites emissions.
  5. General lack of substantiated data to support the effectiveness of reported sustainability initiatives.

**Key Findings:**
  1. Discrepancies in lending and "net zero" pledges indicating differing ambitions.
  2. Increased Scope 3 emissions without adequate context or justification.
